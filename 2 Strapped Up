2.With your boots strapped up, it's time to make a footprint (layout - column classes) 
a. Don't touch that... 
  i. before you start code gather requirements. (show requirements for winery) 
    -The site shall have 5 pages
    *home page
    *about page
    *news and events
    *directions
    *contact us
    *photo gallery
    
    -the site shall have a footer 
    *containing copyright reservations (Copyright 2015. Company Name. All rights reserved.)
    *press 
    *contact info
    
    -the site shall render on desktops
    
    -the site shall render on mobile devices
    
    -the site shall respond properly to touch 
    
  ii. still no touchy -- think about layout. how will users navigate between pages? 
    -Nav bar?
      *navbar on top?
      *navbar on leftside?
      
    -Pills?
      *on top?
      *stacked?
    
  iii. now for something completely different -- don't code...what look and feel will the page need? 
    -Is there a need for a big message front and center?
    
    -Should there be a "carousel"?
    
    -Will the theme be sleek/sophisticated or bright/carefree?
    
  iv. start coding.
    -nav bar
    -jumbotron
    -grid / columns
    -button sizes
