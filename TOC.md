Topic: What is it and why its important
We live in the digital age where businesses live and die by their website.  It is a complex and ever changing landscape where site visitors demand a seamless user experience, a website that displays properly regardless of screen size, and dynamic pages that present information quickly and updates in real time.  Without the proper tools it can be a herculean task to create a site that looks good and meets the expectations of both business owner and site visitor.

Whether you are the CEO of a lean startup, a volunteer at a charitable organization, or a software engineer, web development skills are a mandatory tool in you professional skillset.  The Hands-On with Bootstrap and Angular course is designed for participants who are familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but by no means do you need to be an expert.

This course will walk you through the fundamentals of Bootstrap and Angular, first teaching bitesize morsels of core concepts then giving you an opportunity to exercise your new knowledge by coding along in the next video.  By the end of the course you will have a sleek, dynamic, and responsive website built on Bootstrap and AngularJS.  More importantly, the website you build in Hands-On with Bootstrap and AngularJS is not going to be a site for a made up business, it will be the foundation of your new website!  The course will lead you through the creation of what you could consider a template for your site and in the end you will have the full knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Angular to tweak the template to make it the perfect site for your business or portfolio.
